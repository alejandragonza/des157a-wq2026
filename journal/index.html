        <p>The things that I noticed to make the best practices for form design was to make it as simple as possible. As the user goes through the motions of filling out the form the little amount of information and steps is better in order to increase the probability of them completing it. Another thing that I noticed was that providing the user with a visual of which step they are on is incredibly useful for them too. It allows for retention to still be there. As I continued reading the article it is clear that creating a vertical form is more ideal than a horizontal form, since the user is going to be moving down the form like a list. There are little details that I think people don't realize that actually improve the experience of the user like having a list for things instead of a drop down menu, having no default text, etc. these small features can also increase the likelihood of them completing it.</p>

        <p>I think this webiste exemplifies the best practices because there isnt a lot of information or jargon when searching for items, checking out, and viewing sub tabs. </p>
