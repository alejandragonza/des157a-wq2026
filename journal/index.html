        <p> The things that I noticed within the reading was that the purpose of an overlay was a creative solution to a design challenge of conveying important information without losing context. I think this is really important because when thinking about the purpose of an overlay it really is something to bring attention to the user but to not deter them from the reason they are at specific sites, etc. Another thing that I noticed was the clear transformation that the overlay took in the design process. As more and more people designed the overlay, designers thought of more ways to make it more user friendly. Noted within the article it states that just because you can make an overlay doesn't mean you should. It further implies that the overlay should be introduced depending on the user and the demographics. It is important to know who your audience is. Another thing that I enjoyed within the reading was that it provided the user with clear definitions of what words meant and things that were commonly seen with overlays.

        <p>The things that I noticed to make the best practices for form design was to make it as simple as possible. As the user goes through the motions of filling out the form the little amount of information and steps is better in order to increase the probability of them completing it. Another thing that I noticed was that providing the user with a visual of which step they are on is incredibly useful for them too. It allows for retention to still be there. As I continued reading the article it is clear that creating a vertical form is more ideal than a horizontal form, since the user is going to be moving down the form like a list. There are little details that I think people don't realize that actually improve the experience of the user like having a list for things instead of a drop down menu, having no default text, etc. these small features can also increase the likelihood of them completing it.</p>

        <p>I think this webiste exemplifies the best practices because there isnt a lot of information or jargon when searching for items, checking out, and viewing sub tabs. </p>
